Welcome to my personal site, where I irregularly post technical notes, usually
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] or [[https://haskell-lang.org/][Haskell]]-related. I am developer at [[https://wix.com/][Wix]] during the daytime, and
developer at home before and after the daytime. When I am not writing code, I am
either drinking tea (with these little cups) or drinking wine (Sicily, I love
you). Cheese is my bread and tracking everything in Emacs is my cheese.
