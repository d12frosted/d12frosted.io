I'm an engineering manager from Kyiv, Ukraine. My time is often consumed by work, tinkering with Emacs, delving into the world of wine, and embarking on quests in [[https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/][Final Fantasy XIV]] (or other video games).

I share much of my Emacs journey on GitHub, alongside musings on this site.

I also detail my experiences with wine and the various tasting events I partake in or organise on [[https://barberry.io][üçá Barberry Garden ü¶Ñ]].

If you appreciate my content, consider supporting me through [[https://www.buymeacoffee.com/barberrygarden][Buy Me A Coffee]] or [[https://www.patreon.com/d12frosted][Payoneer]].

P.S. d12frosted means dice with 12 sides from the Chessex‚Ñ¢ frosted series. I used to play. Just a little bit.
