Welcome to my personal site, where I irregularly post technical notes, usually
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] or [[https://haskell-lang.org/][Haskell]]-related. I am developer at [[https://wix.com/][Wix]] during the daytime, and
developer at home before and after the daytime. When I am not writing code, I am
either drinking wine or drinking tea (with these little cups). Cheese is my
bread and tracking everything in Emacs is my cheese. So welcome!
