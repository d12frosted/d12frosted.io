  "description": "Sharing how I improved the agenda view for org-roam notes by fixing category display. Rather than showing file IDs, we can now show meaningful categories based on note titles or explicit CATEGORY properties. I've included a function to automatically extract and format categories, plus options to handle long titles gracefully. The result is a cleaner, more readable agenda that better integrates with org-roam's note-taking approach.",
