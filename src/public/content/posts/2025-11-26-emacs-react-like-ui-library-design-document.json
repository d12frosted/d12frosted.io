  "description": "vui.el (Virtual UI) is a declarative, component-based UI library for Emacs. It brings React-like patterns to buffer-based interfaces: define components as functions of state, compose them into trees, and let the library handle efficient updates through reconciliation. Built on top of widget.el for battle-tested input handling, vui.el adds state management, automatic re-rendering, cursor preservation, and layout primitives for building complex, interactive UIs in Emacs buffers.",
