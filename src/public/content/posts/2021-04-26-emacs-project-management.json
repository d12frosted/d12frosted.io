  "description": "I'm sharing my experience and observations about build tools for Emacs packages. While makem.sh is wonderfully simple and cask is a robust classic, I've found eldev's extensibility and native Emacs Lisp implementation particularly useful. The choice really depends on your needs - makem.sh is great for simpler projects, but when you need more customization, tools like eldev or cask become more attractive.",
