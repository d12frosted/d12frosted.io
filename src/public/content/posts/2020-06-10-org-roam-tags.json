  "description": "Sharing some functions I wrote to better manage tags in org-roam notes. While this functionality is now part of org-roam v2 (use org-roam-tag-add and org-roam-tag-remove instead), the code demonstrates how to extend org-roam's capabilities and work with its database. The implementation focused on making tag management more intuitive with completion support.",
