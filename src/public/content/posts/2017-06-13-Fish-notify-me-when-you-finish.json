  "description": "Sharing a simple Fish shell hack I built to help stay focused - it notifies me when long-running commands complete instead of getting distracted while waiting. The solution uses Fish's CMD_DURATION variable to detect lengthy commands and send notifications when they finish. While originally made for macOS, you can easily adapt it for other systems.",
