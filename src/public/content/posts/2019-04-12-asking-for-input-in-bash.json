  "description": "Sharing how I improved a configuration script by creating a reusable 'ask' function that handles both required and optional inputs. Instead of using eval for variable manipulation, I opted for bash's safer indirection and declare features. The result is cleaner, more maintainable code that's still compatible across different bash versions.",
