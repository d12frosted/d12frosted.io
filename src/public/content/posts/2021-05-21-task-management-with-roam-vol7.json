  "description": "Sharing my org-roam capture workflow, focusing on quick task entry and efficient processing. I've set up a dedicated inbox file per machine to avoid sync issues, and use org-agenda with the REFILE tag to process captured items. For meetings, I've created a smarter capture template that automatically places one-on-one notes in the right person's file - a nice example of using org-roam's query capabilities to streamline capture.",
