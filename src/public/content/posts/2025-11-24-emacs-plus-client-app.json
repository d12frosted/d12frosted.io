  "description": "After fixing PATH injection on macOS 15, I'm dusting off a year-old feature: proper Finder integration for emacsclient. Using AppleScript instead of shell scripts, Emacs Client.app now handles file opening from Finder, drag-and-drop, and auto-starts the daemon. With one cosmetic icon issue that needs your help to solve.",
