  "description": "Sharing my custom Emacs functions for smarter line navigation. I've created enhanced alternatives to move-to-beginning-of-line that first jump to meaningful content before the actual line start. The org-mode version is particularly useful, handling headlines, TODO items, and list bullets intelligently. These functions make code navigation more intuitive without adding external package dependencies.",
