  "description": "Sharing my initial venture into AppleScript with a GitHub API client I wrote while building an OmniFocus integration. While it works for my needs - fetching GitHub issue details to create OmniFocus tasks - it's quite basic and has some limitations. The script supports simple authentication and data extraction, though it could be more efficient when fetching multiple values.",
