  "description": "Sharing my migration experience from org-roam v1 to v2. The update brings major improvements like mandatory IDs, better note structure, and improved database queries - though it requires effort to migrate. I've included my migration script and explained the key changes, especially around note tagging and database access. V2 is a big step forward, making org-roam more stable and powerful for non-hierarchical note-taking.",
