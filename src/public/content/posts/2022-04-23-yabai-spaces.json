  "description": "Sharing my yabai configuration for automatically setting up workspaces in macOS. I walk through how to create a consistent set of labelled spaces, clean up extras, and automatically move applications to specific workspaces on startup. Whilst tiling window managers aren't for everyone, this setup helps maintain an organised workflow by ensuring applications always land in their designated spaces.",
