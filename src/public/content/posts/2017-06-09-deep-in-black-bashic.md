It's been a while since my last blog post. You know how it works, right? Family to care about, work to be done, places to visit, nature to explore, tea to experience, wine to enjoy, WoW to waste your time on… And then you think to yourself: 'I want to write something for my long-forgotten blog. Something that would interest at least someone'. And then you realise that your blog is 'hosted' on the cheapest [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance and has terrible loading time. You try to fix it by moving to [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) with [CDN](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront), but you still have `hakyll` as your blog compiler and not everything works as you'd hoped. You fix several minor issues and then you notice the part where you upload your blog using some black bashic, so you go to [CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) and [CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/) to automate everything and end up configuring [Docker](https://www.docker.com). You waste time and money, but comfort yourself by saying, 'At least I'm learning something new, something I can share with folks later'.

That's how it works, isn't it?
