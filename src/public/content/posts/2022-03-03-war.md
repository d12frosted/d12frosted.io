This blog is definitely not a place to talk about politics. But since the war affects my life and ability to contribute to open source, to maintain projects, and to communicate with people asking for help, I feel obligated to say a few things on this matter.

I'm going to be even less responsive than usual. So this is the right time to jump in to help with maintenance of projects you'd love to stay alive. Just send me an email or open an issue on GitHub and we'll work it out.

You can help in various ways. Our army is doing miracles whilst defending Ukraine, but it needs help in the form of medicine and equipment (like walkie-talkies, bullet-proof vests, combat helmets, etc.). The most straightforward way of helping is donating money directly to Ukraine's Armed Forces or to [Come Back Alive](https://savelife.in.ua/en/) fund. If you wish to help civilians in hot areas, there are many volunteers helping them (by evacuation or humanitarian help) - just contact me via email and we'll work it out.

Thank you all for your support. I appreciate your kind words. I appreciate all the support Ukraine receives during this war.
