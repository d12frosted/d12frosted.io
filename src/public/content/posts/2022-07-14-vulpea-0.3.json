  "description": "Announcing Vulpea v0.3, with major performance improvements for note querying operations. The release introduces a materialized view table that provides a 4.5x speed boost for general queries, plus specialized query functions that can be up to 150x faster in certain scenarios. While write operations take a small hit, the trade-off is worth it for large note collections. I've also added several quality-of-life improvements like better metadata handling and new tag utility functions.",
