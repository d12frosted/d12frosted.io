It's amusing how I keep trying (and failing) to escape the clutches of `org-mode`. I have several major concerns about using it as both a GTD system and a note-taking system. Yet, whatever I try to replace it with, I always return to `org-mode`. Mostly because it's simple (at least at the surface level) and makes me feel more confident about my thoughts, tasks, and the future. On the other hand, it frustrates me because it forces uncomfortable decisions.

Michael Hall has an excellent [blog post](https://mike.puddingtime.org/vintage/2010/02/03/orgmode-in-your) about `org-mode` being a GNU-shaped devil on his dot unplanned blog. It's a genuinely interesting read. My favourite part is about the devilish nature of Emacs in general and `org-mode` in particular.

> With Emacs, you don’t just go “la la la … I’m gonna add org mode back and call it a day!” You think to yourself, “I love org mode. I wish there was an easy way to turn an e-mail message into a todo …” and the next thing you know you’re dealing with how to configure GNUS.

> Then you think “All my calendar stuff is in Google calendar … how can I get it into my org mode agenda?” and that means you’re off reading this guy’s page and just getting angrier and angrier.
>
> Then you go in the kitchen and make a drink, and while you’re making it and calming down you think to yourself, if I’m doing all this stuff in Emacs anyhow, what would it hurt to follow Twitter in Emacs?

> Now you’re not drinking because you’re angry … you’re drinking because you wonder what happened to you and it makes you sad. But you’re drunk, so it seems like a perfectly good idea to build an entire Web site using nothing but Emacs because then you can get a LaTeX version of it for if the asteroids hit and their radiation destroys all HTML. And having decided to do that, part of you thinks about how glad you are you have org mode, so you can organize the lengthy process of making sure you never have to leave Emacs again.

Indeed. The more time passes, the more complex features I impose on myself. When I stop thinking about it, though, I'm genuinely happy. Because I know that I started using Spacemacs on 16 April 2015. That today I have two important meetings and a booked table at a Chinese restaurant. And most importantly, there's a clear list of PRs I'm going to merge over the weekend. This is true happiness, isn't it? And addiction is a wonderful thing.
