Hi, my name is Boris, and I'm an engineering manager from Chișinău, Moldova; based in Kyiv, Ukraine. My time is often consumed by work, tinkering with Emacs, delving into the world of wine, and embarking on quests in [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/) (or other video games).

I share much of my Emacs journey on GitHub, alongside musings on this site.

I also detail my experiences with wine and the various tasting events I partake in or organise on [🍇 Barberry Garden 🦄](https://barberry.io).

If you appreciate my content, consider supporting me through [Payoneer](https://www.patreon.com/d12frosted).

P.S. d12frosted means dice with 12 sides from the Chessex™ frosted series. I used to play. Just a little bit.
