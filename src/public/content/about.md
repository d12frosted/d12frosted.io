Hi, I'm Boris - an engineering manager from Chișinău, Moldova, currently based in Kyiv, Ukraine.

It's no secret that I spend most of my free time tinkering with Emacs. This site is where I write about that journey - the tools I build, the problems I solve, and the occasional opinion I can't keep to myself. Most of my work ends up as open source on GitHub.

When I'm not in Emacs, I'm either exploring wine (documented on [Barberry Garden](https://barberry.io) - a personal wine database built with Emacs and org-mode, because of course it is), embarking on quests in [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/), or writing about games, books, anime and movies on [tasogare.ink](https://tasogare.ink).

**P.S.** d12frosted means dice with 12 sides from the Chessex frosted series. I used to play tabletop RPGs. Just a little bit.
