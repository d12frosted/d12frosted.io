Hi, I'm Boris—an engineering manager from Chișinău, Moldova, currently based in Kyiv, Ukraine. My time is split between work, tinkering with Emacs, exploring the world of wine, and embarking on quests in [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/) (and other video games).

I share my Emacs journey through open source projects on GitHub, alongside technical writing and musings on this site.

I also document my wine experiences and tasting events on [🍇 Barberry Garden 🦄](https://barberry.io)—a personal wine database built with Emacs and org-mode.

If you appreciate my work, consider [supporting me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/d12frosted).

**P.S.** d12frosted means dice with 12 sides from the Chessex™ frosted series. I used to play tabletop RPGs. Just a little bit.
