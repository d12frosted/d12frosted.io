description: The most important thing in Emacs

It's not a secret that I enjoy using Emacs. And people often ask me why it's
Emacs and not Vi(m). The top issue for me is the modal editing thing. Somehow I
just don't get it. I understand that some people are able to fully utilize this
feature, but I can't say that about myself. In any case, recently I was reading
an [[http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5237][article on Irreal]] about Vim being not that hard to learn compared to Emacs
and found a link to another interesting [[https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1#.rqcouk4l1][article about composability of Vim]].

I totally agree that composability is a great feature that unfortunately wasn't
widely adopted. It's very powerful in use and great in terms of learnability and
consistency. Just as Mike Kozlowski has stated. I don't want to repeat his
article, instead just go ahead and read it.

What I want to do is to defend Emacs (and some other editors). I really think
that it was very smart move to place the stake on the ability to extend the
editor. And Emacs is a great example of such editor. Just take a look at ~evil~.
Whenever I think about it, I am amazed. It doesn't mean that I want to use it,
it just shows that extensibility matters and its limits are very loose.

Let's return to composability in Emacs. One might argue that Emacs comes with
built-in composability, but let's be honest even if it's not true - it's still
[[https://github.com/paldepind/composable.el][easy to implement]] vim-like composability even in Emacs. It's just a matter of
effort.

To follow Mike Kozlowski's trend, I admit that Emacs is not perfect. Some people
don't like Emacs Lisp, and out-of-box experience is far from being ideal. In
order to perfect Emacs The Editor you have to invest a lot of time in writing
configurations. You also have to use dozens of third-party packages and also
configure them appropriately. But it gives you freedom. And in case you don't
like writing configs, just take a look at these great projects -
[[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][Purcell's emacs.d]], [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Prelude]] and of
course, [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs.]] You have plenty of options. And composability is one of them.
