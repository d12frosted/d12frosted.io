description: Procrastination leads to no updates in this blog

It's been a while since my latest blog post. You know how it works, right?
Family to care about, work to be done, places to visit, nature to explore, tea
to experience, wine to enjoy, WoW to waste your time on... And then you think to
yourself: 'I want to write something to my long forgotten blog. Something that
would interest at least someone'. And then you realise that your blog is
'hosted' on the cheapest [[https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/][EC2]] instance and has terrible loading time. You try to
fix it by moving to [[https://aws.amazon.com/s3/][S3]] with [[https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront][CDN]], but you still have =hakyll= as a blog compiler
and not everything works as you wish. You fix several minor issues and then you
notice the part where you upload your blog using some black bashic, so you go to
[[https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/][CodeBuild]] and [[https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/][CodeDeploy]] to automate everything and end up configuring [[https://www.docker.com][Docker]].
You waste time and money, but comfort yourself saying 'At least I am learning
something new, something I can share with folks later'.

That's how it works, isn't it?
