description: Announcement of the third major version of CanonicalPath
---

Recently there was the third major release of ~CanonicalPath~ library
introducing some good stuff, but unfortunately breaking API (just a tiny little
bit).

New version is available on [[https://github.com/d12frosted/CanonicalPath][Github]], [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/system-canonicalpath][Hackage]] and [[https://www.stackage.org/package/system-canonicalpath][Stackage]].

New version has the following changes:

- Remove ~UnsafePath~ data type. It was a synonym to ~FilePath~ and was
  confusing me sometimes, so I decided to cut it off.
- Rename ~cpathToText~ to ~toText'~.
- Remove ~pathToText~ and ~textToPath~.
- Export ~toText~ and ~fromText~ from ~Filesystem.Path.CurrentOS~.
- Export ~fromPrelude~ and ~toPrelude~ functions.
- Improve performance (path canonicalization now is performed 1.6x faster than
  before). Now that I have tests and criterion, I can measure performance.
- Improve ~canonicalPath~ error messages. Most important - now it respects
  errors from ~System.Directory.canonicalizePath~.
- Add tests.
- Add Travis support.
- Update documentation.

As always - suggestions and pull requests are welcome!
