Hi, Iâ€™m Boris Buliga, a backend developer [[https://wix.com/][@Wix]]. I code in [[https://haskell-lang.org/][Haskell]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs Lisp]],
[[https://www.scala-lang.org/][Scala]] and whatever suits my needs. I am tea addict, wine lover and a traveler.
Most of my projects are open source and you can check them out on GitHub.
Occasionally, I write stuff here.
