The repository I update the most - collection of configurations for various
application and tools ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], [[https://fishshell.com/][fish shell]], [[https://xmonad.org/][xmonad]] and others), small utilities
and scripts.

It is also home for Eru - script that I use to setup and maintain my
environment. It takes care of fetching and updating repositories, packages,
linking files, rebuilding xmonad etc.
