Repository containing source code of this site. It is built using [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Hakyll]] - a
Haskell library for generating static sites. While my site is pretty simple,
here are some things that you can grab:

- projects listing which gets stargazers count from GitHub during build phase
  (it's static site after all);
- json-based configuration;
- delayed posts.
