Source code of this site. It is built using [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Hakyll]] - a Haskell library for
generating static sites. While my site is pretty simple, it has several
interesting(?) parts. For example, json-configuration, projects, delayed posts
that will become available somewhere at the date (easy to add support of time as
well).
