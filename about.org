Hello, my name is Boris Buliga. I am backend developer [[https://wix.com/][@Wix]]. I make the world
betterâ„¢ in [[https://haskell-lang.org/][Haskell]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs Lisp]], [[https://www.scala-lang.org/][Scala]] and whatever suits my current task. Most
of my projects are open sourced and available on GitHub. Outside of the digital
world, I am a tea addict, wine lover and a traveller.
