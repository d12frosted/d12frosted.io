<p>I grow under the sun. When I am not writing code, I am either drinking wine or drinking tea (with these little cups). Cheese is my bread and tracking everything in Emacs is my cheese.</p>
<p>P.S. d12frosted means dice with 12 sides from the Chessexâ„¢ frosted series. I used to play. Just a little bit.</p>
