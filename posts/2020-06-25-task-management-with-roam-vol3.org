In the previous articles ([[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2020-06-23-task-management-with-roam-vol1.html][vol1]] and [[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2020-06-24-task-management-with-roam-vol2.html][vol2]]) we walked the path to [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]] and
solved the issue with garbage in the category column of agenda. Today we are
going to explore meta projects dedicated to specific person, tag inheritance and
moving such projects to separate =org-roam= files. As result, we will have code
for automatic tagging based on the title.

Aside from regular meta projects (like personal blog) I also create meta
projects for people and locations. This is helpful, because some of the tasks
are really related to someone specifically. For example, when I need to return a
borrowed book, I just create a task for this.

#+begin_src org
  ,* Frodo Baggins                                               :@FrodoBaggins:

  ,** TODO Return 'The Lord of the Rings' book

  ,** TODO Farewell party                                             :PROJECT:

  It feels like Mr. Frodo is about to live Shire. So we are going to setup a
  farewell party for him.

  ,*** TODO Talk to Samwise Gamgee                            :@SamwiseGamgee:

  ,*** TODO Talk to Meriadoc Brandybuck                  :@MeriadocBrandybuck:

  ,*** TODO Talk to Peregrin Took                              :@PeregrinTook:

  ,*** TODO Tie a pair of wool socks

  I am not sure where he is going, so a pair of warm wool socks should be good.
  At least they can be used to protect bottles of wine during journey. That is in
  case Frodo doesn't wear socks. But how could it be? Everyone does!
#+end_src

*Change Log:*

- [2021-01-24 Sun] Since some of the functionality mentioned in the original
  article was merged to =org-roam=, all code is updated to reflect the current
  state of affairs.
- [2021-03-02 Tue]: Update naming convention to match [[https://github.com/d12frosted/environment/tree/master/emacs][personal configurations]].

Now, apart from some misconception about hobbits, there are few important points
to note.

1. Due to [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tag-Inheritance.html][tags inheritance]], all of the subheadings of =Frodo Baggins= have
   =@FrodoBaggins= tag.
2. Tasks tagged with other people also have the =@FrodoBaggins= tag.

Thanks to inheritance, it's easy to find all tasks related to Frodo Baggins via
=org-agenda=. It even enables the search of overlapping tasks. For example,
tasks related to Frodo and Samwise. For more information, take a look at the
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Matching-tags-and-properties.html#Matching-tags-and-properties][matching tags and properties]] section of the manual.

With =org-roam=, each person has its own file.

In order to maintain the feature where =@FrodoBaggins= tag is applied to all
TODO items we have to use =FILETAGS= property. I am also using [[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2020-06-10-org-roam-tags.html][org-roam tags]] to
mark Frodo Baggins as a person. This helps me in two ways. First of all, it
gives me clear understanding that this entity is a person (some people do have
strange names). Secondly, it serves me in automation and filtering.

Now, when I see a headline with title and tag being literally the same (with few
programmable exceptions) or the file with =TITLE= and =FILETAGS= being the same
(with few programmable exceptions), I am feeling nervous. Especially since I am
prone to mistakes.

So what I do - I automate =FILETAGS=. I have a function =vulpea-ensure-filetag=
which automatically sets the =FILETAGS= buffer property for =org-roam= entries
tagged as =People=. The following code reuses most of the functions from
[[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2020-06-10-org-roam-tags.html][org-roam tags]] post.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun vulpea-ensure-filetag ()
    "Add respective file tag if it's missing in the current note."
    (interactive)
    (let ((tags (org-roam--extract-tags-prop
                 (buffer-file-name
                  (buffer-base-buffer)))))
      (when (and (seq-contains-p tags "People")
                 (null (org-roam--extract-global-props-keyword
                        '("FILETAGS"))))
        (org-roam--set-global-prop
         "FILETAGS"
         (vulpea--title-to-tag (vulpea-buffer-prop-get "TITLE"))))))

  (defun vulpea--title-to-tag (title)
    "Convert TITLE to tag."
    (concat "@" (s-replace " " "" title)))
#+end_src

This function can be called interactively, but since I usually place the tag
using =vulpea-tags-add=, I just add the =vulpea-ensure-filetag= to the end of
that function.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun vulpea-tags-add ()
    "Add a tag to current note."
    (interactive)
    (when (org-roam-tag-add)
      (vulpea-ensure-filetag)))
#+end_src

Though for other purposes one can put this function to the file visit hook. But
hooks are sensitive, so I am going to stop here.

In the [[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2020-07-07-task-management-with-roam-vol4.html][next article]] we are going to talk about automatic insertion of person tag
(e.g. =@FrodoBaggins=) when mentioning this person in other task.
