In the [[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2020-06-25-task-management-with-roam-vol3.html][previous article]] we covered automatic tagging of notes related to a
specific person, and today we are going to cover automatic tagging of an
org-mode heading upon insertion of link related to a person. To put it simple,
when I mention someone in the task, I would love this task to be automatically
tagged with that persons name. As they say, it's better to see once, than
imagine multiple times, so here is a screencast.

*[2021-01-24 Sun]* Since some of the functionality mentioned in the original
article was merged to =org-roam=, all code is updated to reflect the current
state of affairs.

The solution is based on the relatively recent [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/839][pull request]] to the org-roam.
Instead of using =org-roam-insert= directly, we can write a wrapper for it
leveraging the return value, name manipulation from the [[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2020-06-25-task-management-with-roam-vol3.html][previous article]] and
tags lookup from [[http://localhost:8000/posts/2020-06-10-org-roam-tags.html][Org-roam tags]] article.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun +org-notes-insert ()
    "Insert a link to the note."
    (interactive)
    (when-let*
        ((res (org-roam-insert))
         (path (plist-get res :path))
         (title (plist-get res :title))
         (roam-tags (org-roam-with-file path nil
                      (org-roam--extract-tags path))))
      (when (seq-contains-p roam-tags "People")
        (save-excursion
          (ignore-errors
            (org-back-to-heading)
            (org-set-tags
             (seq-uniq
              (cons
               (+org-notes--title-to-tag title)
               (org-get-tags nil t)))))))))
#+end_src

The implementation is straight-forward. We start with calling =org-roam-insert=
that asks for the note to insert. Then we parse result and query the roam tags
to understand if the inserted note is related to a person. And if the answer is
yes, we use =org-set-tags= to automatically tag the heading.

In my case, implementation of =+org-notes--title-to-tag= is the following.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun +org-notes--title-to-tag (title)
    "Convert TITLE to tag."
    (concat "@" (s-replace " " "" title)))
#+end_src

And that's it! Keep in mind, that with this approach automatic tagging does not
happen when mentioning people using company interface (e.g. using
=org-roam-company=) and when using =+org-notes-insert= to mention someone
unknown to your system (e.g. when you create a new file). Both of the 'features'
can be implemented using hooks.

P.S. =+org-notes-insert= can be modified to skip tagging when called with
universal argument. Feel free to reach me if you need help with that!
