Project management tool, or a build tool, is an instrument for building, linting
and testing packages. When it comes to Emacs, there are many options out in the
wild. Arguably, the most popular options are [[https://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][cask]] and [[https://github.com/alphapapa/makem][alphapapa/makem]], both
being wonderful tools with different approach.

[[https://github.com/alphapapa/makem][alphapapa/makem]] is a rather small bash script (around 1200 LoC) with aim on
simplicity and transparency. Many projects have adopted it recently, because it
is easy to setup (no configuration or initialization needed) and claims to have
zero dependencies (except for the latest =bash=, which sometimes is not clear
from the errors). You simply add a bash script to your repository.

I don't use it in my projects anymore simply because there is no good way to
extend =makem= without modifying its sources. This makes it hard to upgrade
=makem= to the latest version as you need to deal with potential conflicts. In
addition, it is written in bash, meaning that Emacs Lisp interop is very dirty
and hard to maintain. I've hit =makem= limit and decided to switch. Though in
general it is a very nice project!

[[https://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Cask]] is a classic Emacs package project management tool. It is sophisticated,
powerful and well documented. It requires to be installed on each developers
machine, making it a little bit less approachable, though many package managers
provide =cask=, so it's as easy as installing latest =bash=.

| tool    | language   | extensible | requires installation |
|---------+------------+------------+-----------------------|
| =makem= | bash       | no         | no, but yes           |
| =cask=  |            | yes        | yes                   |
| =eldev= | Emacs Lisp | yes        | yes                   |
