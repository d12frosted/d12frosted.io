*TL;DR* This post describes an approach to make byte compiler and various
linters happy and *useful* in your =.emacs.d=, while maintaining startup
performance, ability to write embedded packages and test them. This is going to
be a long post, so grab a bottle of wine, snacks and follow me.

The longest project in my life is [[https://github.com/d12frosted/environment][environment]], it started with [[https://github.com/d12frosted/environment/tree/master/emacs][Emacs
configurations]] - personal frustration and my biggest time +waster+ investment. I
might be masochistic, but I never felt sorry for falling into this +trap+ world.
And boy, sometimes it is painful to maintain something in this ever mutating and
mutable dynamic system.

There are various tools to help maintaining Emacs package, all fall into one of
four categories - project management tools (e.g. [[https://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Cask]], [[https://github.com/doublep/eldev/][Eldev]], [[https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh][makem.sh]]),
compiler (e.g. built-in byte compiler), linters (e.g. [[https://github.com/purcell/package-lint][package-lint]], [[https://github.com/mattiase/relint][relint]],
[[https://github.com/gonewest818/elisp-lint/][elisp-lint]], [[https://github.com/emacs-elsa/Elsa][Elsa]]) and test frameworks (e.g. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/index.html][ERT]], [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup][buttercup]]). The tricky part
comes when you want to use them for maintaining your own Emacs configurations,
as they have different requirements from regular packages. At least in my case,
they do.

First of all, I want Emacs to start quickly, meaning that I need to use tools
like =use-package= for deferred loading, but I hate to define additional
functions (and I do that quite a lot) inside =use-packge= macro, meaning that I
will get byte compiler warnings because of missing =(require 'some-package)=.

Secondly, bootstrap process is different as project management tools isolate
your package development from your Emacs configurations, which makes sense in
general, but doesn't make sense when you develop the aforementioned
configurations.

The closest approach I know about is [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom-emacs]], but even there =.emacs.d= is
[[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/46dedb3e3361535052d199e994b641dca2c2cffd/modules/lang/emacs-lisp/config.el#L14][ignored]]. Let me just quote a docstring from there:

#+begin_quote
This checker (flycheck) tends to produce a lot of false positives in your
.emacs.d and private config, so it is mostly useless there. However, special
hacks are employed so that flycheck still does *some* helpful linting.
#+end_quote

But it's Emacs, right? Everything is possible! So let's find a way to make byte
compiler and linters helpful and enable testing of Emacs configurations.

Things to cover:

- eldev vs cask vs makemsh
- straight vs quelpa
- use-package
- autoloads
