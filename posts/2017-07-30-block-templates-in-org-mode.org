title: Block templates in org-mode
tags: emacs, org-mode

TL;DR [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Easy-Templates.html][Easy Templates]]

Anyone would agree that typing =#+BEGIN_SRC ... #+END_SRC= blocks manually feels
*strange*.

In order to make life easier, some people implement helpers to insert these
blocks. For example, Chris Done has =org-begin-template= function in his
[[https://github.com/chrisdone/chrisdone-emacs/blob/master/config/org.el#L30][configs]]. Other people use [[https://github.com/mineo/yatemplate][yatemplate]] to create generic or specific templates for
blocks.

But what is most fascinating, is that =org-mode= bundles with templates for some
structural elements like these blocks. And instead of copy-pasting solutions
into your =.emacs= file, take a look at [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Easy-Templates.html][Easy Templates]].

With this feature, you type =<= followed by template selector, then hit =TAB=
and voilÃ . For source blocks, it's just =<s<TAB>=.

Just for reference, here is a list of available templates and their
corresponding selectors. Please note that this table might become out of date,
so it's better to refer to the official documentation.

| Key | Template                            |

| =c= | =#+BEGIN_CENTER ... #+END_CENTER=   |
| =l= | =#+BEGIN_LaTeX ... #+END_LaTeX=     |
| =L= | =#+LaTeX:=                          |
