You wouldn't expect that, but by this post I announce third major release of
~CanonicalPath~ library.

I am making major release instead of minor because I have broken API (just a
little bit). But I hope that you will like it. OK, so what's new?

- Remove ~UnsafePath~ data type. It was a synonym to ~FilePath~ and was
  confusing me sometimes, so I decided to cut it off.
- Rename ~cpathToText~ to ~toText~'.
- Remove ~pathToText~ and ~textToPath~.
- Export ~toText~ and ~fromText~ from ~Filesystem.Path.CurrentOS~.
- Export ~fromPrelude~ and ~toPrelude~ functions.
- Improve performance (path canonicalization now is performed 1.6x faster than
  before).
- Improve ~canonicalPath~ error messages. Most important - now it respects
  errors from ~System.Directory.canonicalizePath~.
- Add tests.
- Add Travis support.
- Update documentation.

I tried to implement some new good features but failed miserably.

And as always - suggestions and pull requests are welcome!
