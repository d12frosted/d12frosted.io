[[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] is a simple outliner for note taking and list management. It [[d12frosted:/posts/2016-12-20-Being-an-org-mode-addict][doesn't impose]] any complex features on users. This is something users excel at by themselves. My suggestion is to continue this tradition and discover task management capabilities in [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]], an [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] extension for non-hierarchical notes management.

Since org-mode gives a lot of freedom, everyone implements tasks management system differently. In the nutshell, most of the implementations I've seen consist of the following elements.

- Task - the simplest actionable item with some =TODO= state.
- Project - a =TODO= item with outcome requiring multiple steps to achieve it.
- Meta project - long lasting project without a final outcome. It consists of projects or tasks. Think of it as of an area or a category. For example, personal blog is a meta project, as it doesn't have any terminating outcome. It does have projects with specific outcome (like setting up your blog or writing a post) or simple tasks (like renewing SSL certificate), but the blog itself doesn't have an outcome.
- Resource - a person, a tool, a location or whatever possibly related to a task. In plain org-mode usually implemented as a tag.

Take a look at the following example of =org-mode= file with all these elements.

As you can see, it has 2 meta projects: =emacs-plus= and personal blog, each containing a task and a project. Meta projects have their own category property (set by hand or using =org-set-property= which is bound to =C-c C-x p= by default), so in agenda view one can quickly distinguish (and filter) tasks from different meta projects (for example, using =org-agenda-filter-by-category= which is bound to =<= by default).

[[file:/images/2020-06-23-task-management-with-roam-vol1/2022-07-19-21-05-00-org-agenda-filter-by-category.gif]]

Formally (and technically) projects might be defined as a task having sub-tasks, but in this rare case I vote for simplicity - project is a task tagged as =PROJECT=.

When a task relates to a person or some location, I tag it respectively, just use =@= symbol as a prefix to distinguish from utilitarian tags. Agenda helps to quickly find all tasks with specific tag. Use =M-x org-agenda m= or =M-x org-agenda M= (to list only TODO items).

[[file:/images/2020-06-23-task-management-with-roam-vol1/2022-07-19-21-05-13-org-agenda-filter-by-tags.gif]]

With =org-roam= it makes sense to create a separate file for each meta project. In the endless debate 'many small' vs 'few big' org files, =org-roam= favours the former approach (though even this is debatable).

So far the transition was simple. However as you can see, in agenda buffer the inferred category contains garbage - note id.

In the [[d12frosted:/posts/2020-06-24-task-management-with-roam-vol2][next article]] we are going to explore the means to fix the agenda buffer from the unwanted visual garbage. Stay tuned!
