Have you ever been in a situation when you called =git fetch=, stared at the screen for several seconds and then switched to the browser to read something 'useful' while =git= fetches updates? And in five minutes you're like 'Oh wait, I was doing something important, no?'. Rings the bell, doesn't it?

At some point in my life[fn:1], I decided to fix it. The idea is to send a notification whenever fish completes executing a long-running command. It is part of [[https://github.com/d12frosted/environment/tree/master/fish][my configurations]] for a long time and I decided to share it more openly only now. Shame!

Fish already exposes variable =CMD_DURATION= which returns the duration of previous command execution in milliseconds. So it's easy to hack a solution that we can put into =fish_prompt= function.

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
function __d12_prompt__check_duration
  if test $CMD_DURATION
    if test $CMD_DURATION -ge $cmd_notification_threshold
      __d12_prompt__on_duration_exceeded $CMD_DURATION
      __d12_prompt__notify_completion $CMD_DURATION
    end
  end
  set CMD_DURATION 0
end

function __d12_prompt__on_duration_exceeded -a duration
  set_color $fish_color_command
  echo -esn '  ~> duration: '
  set_color $fish_color_param
  echo -es $duration ' ms'
  set_color normal
end

function __d12_prompt__notify_completion -a duration
  if command -v terminal-notifier > /dev/null
    echo -es 'Finished in ' $duration ' ms' | terminal-notifier
  end
end
#+END_SRC

Just call =__d12_prompt__check_duration= at the very beginning[fn:2] of =fish_promt=. Then set the value of =cmd_notification_threshold= to the minimal amount of milliseconds before notification is sent. Good place for setting that value is =config.fish=.

Good luck, and don't procrastinate too much.

P. S. Current implementation of =__d12_prompt__notify_completion= targets macOS users. Make sure you modify it so it works well on your system as well.

[fn:1] Just right after I realised that I have failed to master meditation techniques that would help me to stare into the terminal window until command execution completes without being distracted by other things.

[fn:2] but after you cache the =$status= value.
