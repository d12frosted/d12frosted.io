~flyspell-correct~ is a package for distraction-free words correction with
flyspell via selected interface. It's available on [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct][GitHub]] and [[http://melpa.org/#/flyspell-correct][MELPA]].

Recently, there was a major release of version 0.5 with following changes:

- Skip words that don't need to be fixed (e.g. duplicates).
- Rename several functions (via name deprecation)
  - =flyspell-correct-next-word-generic= -> =flyspell-correct-next=
  - =flyspell-correct-previous-word-generic= -> =flyspell-correct-previous=
  - =flyspell-correct-word-generic= -> =flyspell-correct-at-point=
- Create a wrapper function for most of the cases, namely
  =flyspell-correct-wrapper=.
- Implement a 'rapid mode' for =flyspell-correct-wrapper=, allowing user to fix
  multiple words in one run (=skip= action can be used to skip current incorrect
  word and continue to the next one).
- Add some simple tests to cover the most important use cases.
- Fix issue when =flyspell-correct-next= doesn't correct word at point.
