- Skip words that don't need to be fixed (e.g. duplicates).
- Rename several functions (via name deprecation)
  - =flyspell-correct-next-word-generic= -> =flyspell-correct-next=
  - =flyspell-correct-previous-word-generic= -> =flyspell-correct-previous=
  - =flyspell-correct-word-generic= -> =flyspell-correct-at-point=
- Create a wrapper function for most of the cases, namely =flyspell-correct-wrapper=.
- Implement a 'rapid mode' for =flyspell-correct-wrapper=, allowing user to fix multiple words in one run (=skip= action can be used to skip current incorrect word and continue to the next one).
- Add some simple tests to cover the most important use cases.
- Fix issue when =flyspell-correct-next= doesn't correct word at point.
