As you might know, Eru is the supreme deity of Arda. The first things that Eru created where the Ainur. He then bade the Ainur to sing to him. Each Ainu had a particular theme given by Eru. Sure enough, Eru makes the 'World and All That Is'.

So when I get a new clean system there is nothing yet. And so I call upon the wisdom and power of =Eru.sh= - the one who creates Ainur and the 'World and All That Is'.

#+begin_src bash
  $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d12frosted/environment/master/bootstrap/eru.sh | bash
#+end_src

I just have to wait patiently, while everything is being downloaded and installed, while all configuration cogs are being placed on the right spot.

#+begin_html

#+end_html

The good thing about =Eru.sh= is that after the 'World and All That Is' creation you can still call upon his help and you can even ask him to help with specific theme or themes only.

#+begin_src bash
  $ ./bootstrap/eru.sh                   # to help with all themes
  $ ./bootstrap/eru.sh repositories      # to help with repositories
  $ ./bootstrap/eru.sh repositories brew # to help with repositories and brew
#+end_src

=Eru.sh= reveals all available themes. For example,

#+begin_src text
  => Guardian Theme :: Checking operating system
  => Supporting Theme :: Defining helpers
  => Supporting Theme :: Defining variables
  => Guardian Theme :: Ensure all directories exists
  -> SSH Theme :: Checking SSH keys
  -> Repositories Theme :: Sync environment repository
  -> Repositories Theme :: Sync repositories from Repofile
  -> Linking Theme :: Link all files as defined in Linkfile
#+end_src

Every theme that begins with ~=>~ is a mandatory theme - the one you can't skip. Every theme prefixed with ~->~ is an optional one. If you don't specify any themes, all optional themes are sung. If you do specify at leas t one theme - only specified are sang.

You can find the latest version of =Eru.sh= on [[https://github.com/d12frosted/environment/blob/master/bootstrap/eru.sh][GitHub]].

Mythology is great, but let's check what's cool about =Eru.sh=.

1. It installs and updates a lot of applications and utilities that I use on a daily basis.
2. It installs my configurations for these applications. The most important ones are =Emacs=, =fish=, =skhd=, =chunkwm=. Plus it tries to set up different parts of macOS for my liking.
3. It works in an incremental fashion. In general, it installs only what is missing. So in case when my environment is up to date, =Eru.sh= is almost instant.
4. It allows you to setup only specific parts. For example, you can only install dependencies or sync mandatory repositories. Or do both.

This means, that on a fresh system I can easily get my environment just by running one command and waiting for a long time. But in a working environment, I can easily get the latest version of it. This comes in handy since I use more than one computer.

** Bash magic

=Eru.sh= is written in bash because it must work on systems without Haskell preinstalled. Features of bash4 are not used, because of the same reasons, it is not available on a clean macOS.

=Eru.sh= is mostly a boring bash script. But there are several points that I find interesting myself.

*** Mapping files

:END:

There are themes that perform the same action over a set of arguments. In order to avoid noise in =Eru.sh= these arguments are stored in external files (rule files). For example, =repositories= theme synchronises repositories by rules specified in the =Repofile=, which looks like the following.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  $HOME/.spacemacs syl20bnr/spacemacs develop
  $DEVELOPER/fancy-yank d12frosted/fancy-yank
  $DEVELOPER/orgability d12frosted/orgability
  $DEVELOPER/org-drawer-list d12frosted/org-drawer-list
  $DEVELOPER/flyspell-correct d12frosted/flyspell-correct
#+END_SRC

Every line specifies a rule - target location of the repository, remote repository URL (fir GitHub one case specify only =owner/repo= instead of a full HTTPS/SSH URL) and branch to use.

There is also a function that gets these value as arguments and does all the job. In the case of =repositories= theme, the function is called =sync_repo=.

One can easily write a script reading a given file line by line and passing them to a function. For example,

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  while IFS='' read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]]; do
    sync_repo $line
  done < "Repofile"
#+END_SRC

Please note that =$line= should not be put in parenthesis otherwise whole line will be passed as a first argument, but we want to split it into multiple arguments by a space.

While this works, it doesn't scale, requires repetition and decreases the level of code readability. Let's abstract it a little bit by extracting the logic of reading the lines and passing them to a function.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  function map_lines() {
    while IFS='' read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]]; do
      $1 $line
    done < "$2"
  }

  map_lines sync_repo "Repofile"
#+END_SRC

Now it looks like a Functor for a file. No repetition, it does scale well and we know exactly what is the purpose of =map_lines sync_repo "RepoFile"=.

*** Dealing with multiple optional themes
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:                     25a8e072-56d9-44ff-bc10-383930466c60
:END:

So in =Eru.sh=, we have multiple optional themes. The easiest way to deal with them is to create a separate variable for every theme and then use it to check if we should run an action for a given theme.

#+begin_src bash
  ALL="true"
  REPOSITORIES="false"
  LINKING="false"
  BREW="false"

  POSITIONAL=()

  while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]
  do
    key="$1"
    case $key in
      repo)
        ALL="false"
        REPOSITORIES="true"
        shift # past argument
        ;;
      link)
        ALL="false"
        LINKING="true"
        shift # past argument
        ;;
      brew)
        ALL="false"
        BREW="true"
        shift # past argument
        ;;
      ,*)    # unknown option
        POSITIONAL+=("$1") # save it in an array for later
        shift # past argument
        ;;
    esac
  done
  set -- "${POSITIONAL[@]}" # restore positional parameters

  if [[ "$ALL" = "true" || "$REPOSITORIES" = "true" ]]; then
    optional_theme "Repositories" # logging
    map_lines sync_repo "$target/bootstrap/Repofile"
  else
    inactive_theme "Repositories" # logging
  fi

  if [[ "$ALL" = "true" || "$LINKING" = "true" ]]; then
    optional_theme "Linking" # logging
    map_lines safe_link  "$target/bootstrap/Linkfile"
  else
    inactive_theme "Linking" # logging
  fi

  if [[ "$ALL" = "true" || "$BREW" = "true" ]]; then
    optional_theme "Brew" # logging
    cd "$target/bootstrap" && brew bundle
  else
    inactive_theme "Brew" # logging
  fi
#+end_src

But this gets nasty every time a new theme is added (though it happens rarely). And most importantly, it looks so redundant, so repetitive that I almost fall asleep while writing it.

We can improve it a little bit. Let's focus on the part where we check for a variable value.

#+begin_src bash
  function theme_guard() {
    if [[ "$ALL" = "true" || "$1" = "true" ]]; then
      optional_theme "$2" # logging
      return 0
    else
      inactive_theme "$2" # logging
      return 1
    fi
  }

  theme_guard "$REPOSITORIES" "Repositores" && {
    map_lines sync_repo "$target/bootstrap/Repofile"
  }

  theme_guard "$LINKING" "Linking" && {
    map_lines safe_link  "$target/bootstrap/Linkfile"
  }

  theme_guard "$BREW" "Brew" && {
    cd "$target/bootstrap" && brew bundle
  }
#+end_src

So we moved out all the checks and logging to a helper function. It is already good enough as an improvement, but we can do even better.

Bash provides an ability to evaluate arbitrary code by using =eval=. Please note though, that =eval= is a bane of shell programming and should be avoided like leprosy. In general, it's okayish to use =eval= when you fully control what is passed to it. If you pass user input to =eval= then you have a problem, because now you need to deal with code injection.

We can use =eval= to get the value of a variable by a string.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ CUSTOM_VAR=42

  $ echo '$CUSTOM_VAR'
  $CUSTOM_VAR

  $ eval echo '$CUSTOM_VAR'
  42
#+END_SRC

While this is good enough, it's possible to avoid =eval= in this particular case, when we just want to get the value of variable by name.

#+begin_src bash
  $ CUSTOM_VAR=42

  $ echo '$CUSTOM_VAR'
  $CUSTOM_VAR

  $ CUSTOM_VAR_REF=CUSTOM_VAR

  $ echo ${!CUSTOM_VAR_REF}
  42

#+end_src

Though if you want to expand variables in arbitrary string (like, =$HOME/config.json=), you'll have to use =eval=.

Right now we are passing two arguments to =theme_guard=: a guarding variable value and the name of a theme. But the code looks similar - the first one is prefixed with the =$= sign and is in uppercase, while the second one is in capital case. In order to deal with case, we can use =awk=.

#+begin_src bash
  function theme_guard() {
    key=$(echo "$1" | awk '{print toupper($0)}')
    local guard_ref="guard_$key"
    guard="${!guard_ref}"
    if [[ "$ALL" = "true" || "$guard" = "true" ]]; then
      optional_theme "$1" # logging
      return 0
    else
      inactive_theme "$1" # logging
      return 1
    fi
  }

  theme_guard "Repositores" && {
    map_lines sync_repo "$target/bootstrap/Repofile"
  }

  theme_guard "Linking" && {
    map_lines safe_link  "$target/bootstrap/Linkfile"
  }

  theme_guard "Brew" && {
    cd "$target/bootstrap" && brew bundle
  }
#+end_src

We got a very small improvement - we just don't need to pass the theme name to the =theme_guard= twice. But I find it satisfying anyway. Also, it will come handy a little bit later.

Now let's go back to the variable declaration. It turns out that we can use =eval= to declare variables as well.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ eval 'MEANING=42'

  $ eval echo '$MEANING'
  42
#+END_SRC

But defining variables based on the user input is dangerous. Fortunately, there is a =declare= program designed just for this task. Moreover, it allows declaring read-only variables.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ declare "CUSTOM_VAR=42"

  $ echo $CUSTOM_VAR
  42

  $ CUSTOM_VAR=12

  $ echo $CUSTOM_VAR
  12

  $ declare -r "CUSTOM_VAL=42"

  $ echo $CUSTOM_VAL
  42

  $ CUSTOM_VAL=12
  bash: CUSTOM_VAL: readonly variable
#+END_SRC

So let's use this =declare= for our good.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ALL="true"

  POSITIONAL=()
  while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]
  do
    if [[ "$1" != "" ]]; then
      key=$(echo "$1" | awk '{print toupper($0)}')
      declare -r "$key=true"
      ALL="false"
    fi
    shift
  done
  set -- "${POSITIONAL[@]}" # restore positional parameters
#+END_SRC

While this becomes a little bit harder to understand it saves us a lot of repetition. The only thing I would improve here immediately is to add a unique prefix to variable names, so user does not interfere with other variables. The final version looks like it.

#+begin_src bash
  ALL="true"

  POSITIONAL=()
  while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]
  do
    if [[ "$1" != "" ]]; then
      key=$(echo "$1" | awk '{print tolower($0)}')
      declare -r "guard_$key=true"
      ALL="false"
    fi
    shift
  done
  set -- "${POSITIONAL[@]}" # restore positional parameters

  function theme_guard() {
    key=$(echo "$1" | awk '{print tolower($0)}')
    local guard_ref="guard_$key"
    guard="${!guard_ref}"
    if [[ "$ALL" = "true" || "$guard" = "true" ]]; then
      optional_theme "$1" # logging
      return 0
    else
      inactive_theme "$1" # logging
      return 1
    fi
  }

  theme_guard "Repositores" && {
    map_lines sync_repo "$target/bootstrap/Repofile"
  }

  theme_guard "Linking" && {
    map_lines safe_link  "$target/bootstrap/Linkfile"
  }

  theme_guard "Brew" && {
    cd "$target/bootstrap" && brew bundle
  }
#+end_src

Just by extracting checks into separate function, by using =declare= to define variables and variable indirection to read value of variables we highly improved initial code. Less redundancy, clearer intention and ability to scale in terms of themes.
